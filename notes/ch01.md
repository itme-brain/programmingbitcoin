Chapter 1: Finite Fields
========================
**Finite Fields**: A finite set of numbers that satisfy the following criteria:

  1. **Closed**: If $a$ and $b$ are in the set, $a+b$ and $a*b$ are in the set
  2. **Additive Identity**: $0$ is in the set and $a+0=a$
  3. **Multiplicative Identity**: $1$ is in the set and $a*1=a$
  4. **Additive Inverse**: If $a$ is in the set, $-a$ is in the set: the value that makes $a+(-a)=0$
  5. **Multiplicative Inverse**: If $a$ is in the set and ***is not*** $0$, $a^{-1}$ is in the set: the value that makes $a*a^{-1}=1$

*For identifying a finite field, we need to change how arithmetic behaves to adhere to these criteria*  
*If **ANY** of these criteria are not satisfied then the set **is not** a finite field*

**Primes**: Finite fields must have an order that is a power of a prime

**Modulo Arithmetic**:  
  - *Negative Numbers*: In modulo arithmetic when $mod$ with a positive integer on a negative number, the result is found by adding the $mod$ to the negative number until the result is positive, example:  
    $(3-16)\mod12$ **>>** $3-16={-13}$ **>>** ${-13}+12={-1}$ **>>** ${-1}+12=11$ **therefore** $(3-16)\mod12=11$

Definitions
-----------
**Order** = The size of the field, the order of the field is always the largest element + 1 or $(p-1)$  
**Element** = A member of the field  
$F_p$ = Field of $p$: $\{0,1,2, ..., (p-1)\}$
